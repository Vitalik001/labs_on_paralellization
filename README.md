### Brief description

#### lab3:

In this lab we parallelized integral calculation using mutexes and atomic.

#### lab4

In this lab we implemented our own threadsafe queue and compared results with previous lab


#### lab5

In this lab we implemented our own thread pool and compared results with previous labs

#### lab7

In this lab we parallelized words counting from large archive. We used boost and libarchive libraries

#### lab8

In this lab we used external threadsafe dictionaries and queues from tbb lib. 

#### lab9

In this lab we used tbb::parallel_pipeline for word counting

#### lab10
